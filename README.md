# ✊🤚✌️ Rock, Paper, Scissors Game

A simple command-line game implemented in JavaScript where the player competes against the computer in the classic game of Rock, Paper, Scissors. The player can choose between rock, paper, or scissors, and the game will determine the winner based on the rules of the game. After each round, the player is prompted to decide if they want to play again.

## 🔧 Technologies Used
- **JavaScript**
- **Node.js**
- **readline-sync** for user input handling

## 🚀 How It Works
- The player chooses either rock, paper, or scissors.
- The computer randomly selects its choice.
- The game compares the player's choice against the computer's choice and determines the outcome:
  - **Rock** crushes **Scissors** (Player wins).
  - **Scissors** cuts **Paper** (Player wins).
  - **Paper** covers **Rock** (Player wins).
  - If both choices are the same, it's a tie.
- After each round, the player is asked if they want to play again.
